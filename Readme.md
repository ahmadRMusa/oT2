## Building source files

To compile the source files in the `src` folder, you will need to do the following:

Install [Node and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) if you don't have it already, and then run:

    npm install

Then start the Webpack build system by running:

    npm start
  
oTranscribe should then be accessible at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

To build a distributable `dist` folder, run:

    npm run build

## Testing

Assuming you have already installed dependencies, run:

    npm test
    
## Architecture

### Controllers

These are [Ractive](http://www.ractivejs.org) instances that control the HTML on the page. They live in the **controllers** directory, and their corresponding HTML templates are in the **templates directory**.

### Storage

oTranscribe's storage system is a custom wrapper around [localforage](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage). When initialised, it returns an object with the following methods:

- `list`: Returns promise which resolves to  list of saved files
- `save`: Takes an object with `id` property. Returns promise which resolves to that id.
- `load`: Takes an id (eg. `32`). Returns promise which resolves to a saved file.

### Player

Takes the following arguments:

- `driver`: A valid Player driver (see below)
- `source`: Source file URL

Returns an object of playback controls:

- `play`
- `pause`
- `getTime`: returns time in seconds
- `setTime`: seeks to time in seconds
- `skip`: `'forwards'` or `'backwards'`

#### Player drivers

Player drivers should be objects initialise with a single `source` argument. They live in the **player-drivers** directory. An instance of a player driver should have the following methods:

- `play`
- `pause`
- `getTime`
- `setTime`: argument is time in seconds

Available player drivers:

- `Player.drivers.HTML5_AUDIO`
- (More to come!)
