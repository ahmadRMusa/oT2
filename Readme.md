## Building source files

To compile the source files in the `src` folder, you will need to do the following:

Install [Node and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) if you don't have it already, and then run:

    npm install

Then start the Webpack build system by running:

    npm start
  
oTranscribe should then be accessible at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
